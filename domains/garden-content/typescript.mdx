# Typescript


## Add a global declaration type to a project

To add a global declaration type to a project, you can create a file in the `src` folder called `global.d.ts` and add the following content:

```ts
declare module "*.svg" {
  const content: string;
  export default content;
}
```

This will allow you to import SVG files in your project without TypeScript complaining about it.
