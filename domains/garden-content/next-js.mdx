# Next JS

### Cons

#### Working with Framer Motion

We can see lagged animations during development time specially, when using Framer Motion with Next JS. This is because Next JS is server-side rendered and Framer Motion is a client-side library. To fix this
we can use the `useEffect` hook to render the animations only on the client-side.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const { animate } = require("framer-motion");
    animate();
  }, []);

  return (
    <motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
      Hello World
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```
